# Harmonic-Coordinates-for-Character-Articulation

The code in this repo is an implementation of the method described in the paper called [Harmonic Coordinates for Character Articulation](http://graphics.pixar.com/library/HarmonicCoordinatesB/paper.pdf). We find the harmonic coordinates over an interior area by propagating and forcing zero discrete Laplacian over a discrete grid that spans the cage & interior areas. We take the simplest case of 2D for simplicity and showing the Algorithm that runs on a normal computer.
Credit also goes to the authors of this paper along other referenced papers and surveys. In addition, we thank multiple professors at Ecole Polytechniqe L'X for guidance.
